## Project Description

This project investigates Airbnb listings in New York City to provide data-driven guidance for new hosts. Using a dataset of NYC listings, we perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize insights on optimal property locations, room types, and pricing strategies. The dashboard helps hosts make informed decisions to maximize bookings while remaining competitive within a medium-budget range.
